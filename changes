		Made a static Load() method for each Json files to create the object and load the json file.

		Removed JsonWrapper class form all the projects and created individual class for each json file.
		Program.cs of VSProject Publisher and Updater now only calls methods from Publisher.cs and Updater.cs respectivly.
		Console.WriteLine() calls only takes place in Publisher.cs and Updater.cs
		
	Publisher now doesn't copy the updater during initialization instead it copies it in temp when creating updater (when getupdater is called).
